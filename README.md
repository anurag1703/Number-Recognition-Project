# Number-Recognition-Project
In this Number Recognition project, I have implemented a logistic regression classifier to recognize and classify handwritten digits. The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning, to train and evaluate the model's performance. The logistic regression algorithm efficiently captures patterns in the pixel values of the digit images, making accurate predictions. The code is designed to be accessible and comprehensible, serving as a practical example for those looking to understand the fundamentals of image classification and logistic regression in the context of machine learning.
